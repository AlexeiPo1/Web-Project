      <h1>Grilled Salmon</h1>
      <p>Grilled salmon is a flavorful and healthy dish enjoyed worldwide, especially in Scandinavia, the Pacific Northwest, and Japan. Fresh salmon fillets are seasoned with salt, pepper, lemon, and herbs, then grilled until slightly charred on the outside but tender and juicy inside. Often served with roasted vegetables, rice, or quinoa, it’s rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and essential vitamins. The vibrant pink color of salmon comes from its diet of krill and shrimp, and wild salmon typically has a deeper, more robust flavor than farmed varieties.</p>

      <h1>Lobster Thermidor</h1>
      <p>Lobster Thermidor is a luxurious French dish that originated in the late 19th century, named after the month “Thermidor” in the French Revolutionary calendar. Cooked lobster meat is combined with a creamy mixture of egg yolks, mustard, and brandy, then stuffed back into the shell and baked with a cheesy topping. Traditionally reserved for special occasions due to its richness and the rarity of lobster, this elegant dish is perfect as an impressive entrée, often paired with sautéed vegetables or a crisp salad.</p>

      <h1>Paella</h1>
      <p>Seafood paella is a vibrant Spanish dish from Valencia, combining rice cooked with saffron and stock with shrimp, mussels, clams, and sometimes squid. Cooked in a wide, shallow pan, paella is traditionally served family-style, garnished with fresh herbs and lemon wedges. The “socarrat,” a crispy layer of rice at the bottom, is considered the most flavorful part of the dish. While authentic Valencian paella often includes rabbit and chicken, the seafood version has become popular worldwide for its colorful presentation and bold flavors.</p>

      <h1>Shrimp Scampi</h1>
      <p>Shrimp Scampi is a classic Italian-American dish where large shrimp are sautéed in butter, olive oil, garlic, and white wine, sometimes with a splash of lemon juice. Served over pasta like linguine, it’s garnished with parsley or grated Parmesan and often accompanied by crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Inspired by the Italian “scampi” (small lobsters or langoustines), the dish uses shrimp as a convenient and flavorful substitute. Quick to cook, it delivers tender, garlicky shrimp with a bright, zesty sauce perfect for any occasion.</p>
